# Fountain
A map painting/generating software kit for worldbuilders.

#Installation
Fountain for Windows can be downloaded for installation here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/k9mad4g3hszvsj9/Fountain_Windows.zip?dl=0

If you would like to install Fountain on a Linux or Macintosh operating system, please download and compile the source code provided using Mono. I will, at some point, include a binary for Linux, but I have no Linux machine upon which to perform testing so the task may fall to another poor, unfortunate soul.
#Tutorials
Fountain might be a bit of a headache for some people - it's designed to be very, very flexible but with that comes certain magnitudes of complexity that most people might not be willing to accept. Thankfully; much of that complexity will be done away with if you grab custom brushes and effects from the tutorials or other users.
